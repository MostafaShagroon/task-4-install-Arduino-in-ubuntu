# task-4-install-Arduino-in-ubuntu
the 4th task for me or the 2nd task for the Ai ,so it is downloading and installing Arduino in ubuntu using command line


Welcome to the task-4-install-Arduino-in-ubuntu wiki!

# Opening the ubuntu using VM 
## from some of the previous tasks we got to install ubuntu in VirtualBox now we are continue inside ubuntu as following 
### open browser in ubuntu and copy this URL https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-linux64.tar.xz 
to download the Arduino ide in Ubuntu then extract the file then rename the Arduino file then move it to the base ((home)) folder
# opening the ubuntu to install Arduino
## inside the Arduino file right click then open terminal then cd on the Arduino then ls to show all the files then write $sudo ./install.sh
### after doing the last step you are ought to find Arduino on your desktop in Ubuntu and it is going to function as a normal IDE that connects to the Arduino hardware like for our example the ESP Watson 32.
